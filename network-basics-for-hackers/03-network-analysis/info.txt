Prerequisites to Sniffing
  It's critical to point out that to effectively use a network sniffer, your network interface card (NIC) should
  be in promiscuous mode. This means that your NIC picks up ANY packet traversing the network. Usually, 
  NICs only pick up packets that are intended for their particular MAC (globally unique physical) address.
  The other critical point to understand with network sniffing is that the standard file format for sniffing is
  .pcap (packet capture). This means your system must have a library (a bit of reusable code) to put the
  packets in this format. These libraries are libpcap on your Linux system or Winpcap on Windows system.
