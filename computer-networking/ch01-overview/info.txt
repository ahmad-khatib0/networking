The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals
  simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:
  
• A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
• A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
• An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band

On the customer side, a splitter separates the data and telephone signals arriving to the home and 
  forwards the data signal to the DSL modem. On the telco side, in the CO, the DSLAM separates the 
  data and phone signals and sends the data into the Internet. Hundreds or even thousands of 
  households connect to a single DSLAM.

Although DSL and cable networks currently represent the majority of residential broadband access in 
  the United States, an up-and-coming technology that provides even higher speeds is fiber to the 
  home (FTTH) [Fiber Broadband 2020]. As the name suggests, the FTTH concept is simple—provide an 
  optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home. FTTH can potentially provide Internet access 
  rates in the gigabits per second range.

Physical medium. The physical medium can take many shapes and forms and does not have to be of the 
  same type for each transmitter-receiver pair along the path. Examples of physical media include 
  twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable, multimode fiber-optic cable, terrestrial radio spectrum, 
  and satellite radio spectrum. Physical media fall into two categories: guided media and unguided
  media. With guided media, the waves are guided along a solid medium, such as a fiber-optic cable, 
  a twisted-pair copper wire, or a coaxial cable. With unguided media, the waves propagate in the 
  atmosphere and in outer space, such as in a wireless LAN or a digital satellite channel.

Store-and-Forward Transmission
  Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs to the links. Store-and-forward 
  transmission means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to 
  transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. 

Comparing Transmission and Propagation Delay
  Newcomers to the field of computer networking sometimes have difficulty understanding the 
  difference between transmission delay and propagation delay. The difference is subtle but important. 
  The transmission delay is the amount of time required for the router to push out the packet; it is a 
  function of the packet’s length and the transmission rate of the link, but has nothing to do with the 
  distance between the two routers. The propagation delay, on the other hand, is the time it takes a bit 
  to propagate from one router to the next; it is a function of the distance between the two routers, 
  but has nothing to do with the packet’s length or the transmission rate of the link.
